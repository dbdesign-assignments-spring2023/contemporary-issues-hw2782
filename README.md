# Is it secure for us to continue to use Tiktok? 
## Article 1


In CBS NEWS's [TikTok faces growing national security concerns: "It's not just the collection or theft of that data"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-security-concerns-china-data/)


The author shows that Tiktok, which operates in the U.S. and overseas, secretly collects user information and sends it to the Chinese government to obtain information overseas. I think the author's view is too aggressive because Tiktok's parent company, ByteDance, has set up its database in Singapore, the UK, the US, and other regions that are free from Chinese government regulation in order to avoid comments of data theft. Secondly, as an emerging industry unicorn, its main way of profit is not the data itself, but its unique algorithm of analyzing data, which is used to predict users' habits to keep them enthusiastic about its products and to push appropriate advertising services. It has undergone multiple checks since its launch in Europe and the US, and no security issues such as data leakage have been disclosed so far.


## Article 2


In The Guardian's [Young people using TikTok is no problem, GCHQ chief says](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/11/tiktok-young-people-gchq-chief-jeremy-fleming)


The author mentions the director of GCHQ, Jeremy Fleming, said Tiktok is not at risk of stealing user information for China and encourages young people to use Tiktok for entertainment. Intelligence agencies believe Tiktok is using user information only for profit and not for national affairs. I agree with Jeremey, because I've been using Tiktok myself for five years, and I've felt the progress of its algorithm since Jitterbug became popular in the Chinese market in Chinese New Year 17. Because of the politics in China, its servers in China have to be regulated by the government. For the independence of its overseas business, Tiktok's management and key development staff are all overseas nationals and have the right to operate independently without being ordered by the parent company. So in many ways Tiktok is not at risk of data leakage from data mining of users
